# GTBot-Packet-Finder-Tester
I'm using GrowtopiaBot which has been made by DrOreo002. The link from GrowtopiaBot that I use is below.
https://github.com/DrOreo002/GrowtopiaBot

# How-To-Use
- Just fill in the IP and PORT on the server you want to go to.
- Write the world name too.
- And if so, fill in or create an account first (as used by GrowtopiaBot) then log in.
- If done, run the bot. This bot will do nothing. it only counts or retrieves the packets received by itself.

# If you have problem with the bot, please contact me or you can put the problem into the Issues tab.
